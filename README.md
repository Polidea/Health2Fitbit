# Health2Fitbit

Health2Fitbit is a simple tool that continiously transfers steps recorded in HealthKit (for example from Apple Watch or iPhone) to Fitbit.

#Installation

In order to install Health2Fitbit on your device, you'll have to create your own Fitbit Application on https://dev.fitbit.com:

In order to do this, you'll need to:

1. Go to https://dev.fitbit.com/apps/new
2. Fill form with your app name, description, etc.

Health2Fitbit uses oAuth 1.0 authentication, make sure that "Browser" type is selected there. Also provide "read + write" access to fitbit data.

3. Copy your *Client (Consumer) Key* and *Client (Consumer) Secret*, and fill them in constructor of *H2FHealthManager* class.
4. Build app, and deploy it on your iOS device.

#Usage

After launching the app, tap "login" button, and provide read access to HealthKit steps, and type correct credentials to Fitbit. Right after that, app run in the background, you won't even need to launch it again!

# How it works?

Because Fitbit isn't providing any API's for adding steps, I'm using a little hack here - app is posting steps as separate "Walking" activities. One activity for each hour in a day. 

More or less every hour, when HealthKit detects change in steps count, Health2Fitbit app is launched in the background. After this, app is looking at activities that are already uploaded to Fitbit, even on those that were uploaded 7 days in the past. All differences between steps count on Fitbit and steps count in HealthKit are transferred to Fitbit.
